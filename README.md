# pomodoro-clock
Simple pomodoro clock application to help keep focus while working. A pomodoro clock is essentially a two-part timer, its first timer is when you should be working,
the second timer is when you should be having a break. I aim to:
<ul>
  <li> Improve the design so it looks more user friendly and inviting.
  <li> Add a play/pause button.
  <li> Add a +1 button so the user can add a minute onto break/work time.
  <li> Add a settings page so the user can alter the work/break time.
</ul>
